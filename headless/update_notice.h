// Updates: once per launch the app asks the homebrew.page catalog whether a newer release of
// itself is listed, and can replace itself with it when the player says so.
//
// Both are the PS5 Native App Boilerplate's self-update kit (headless/update_check, see its
// README.md): the check fetches the catalog's signed manifest and the app's own entry, verifies
// the Ed25519 signature and the hashes, and compares the listed content version with this
// build's (sce_sys/param.json). The update downloads the release ZIP from GitHub over HTTPS and
// streams it to the self-update helper (self-updater.elf in the app's folder), which the app
// sends to the console's payload loader: the helper checks and unpacks the release beside the
// app, and once the app has closed it replaces the app's files and posts a notification. Nothing
// is changed before the player confirms, and a failure or a cancel leaves the app as it was.
